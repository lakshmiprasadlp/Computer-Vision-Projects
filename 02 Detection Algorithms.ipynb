    "\n",
    "* 🐢 **Slow and accurate**.\n",
    "* 🧩 Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Uses **Selective Search** to propose \\~2000 regions.\n",
    "  2. Runs a **CNN** on each region.\n",
    "  3. Classifies and adjusts bounding boxes.\n",
    "* ❌ Very **slow** (needs to process each region separately).\n",

    "* 🧠 Improvement over R-CNN.\n",
    "* 📸 Run the CNN over the **whole image once**.\n",
    "* 🧱 Then use **RoI Pooling** to extract features for each region.\n",
